The Jose Marie Q. Almirante Medical Scholarship Foundation, in partnership with two organizations, held a medical mission in the remote barangay of Dansolihon, Cagayan de Oro City, on September 25, 2011, Sunday.

The director of the foundation is Atty. Eduardo Q. Almirante Jr., CPA. The two other organizations are Cekas Development Corporation, headed by its CEO, Mr. Rafael Magsaysay and G39 Development Corporation, under its President, Engr. Gilbert Besana.

More than 200 residents of this poor barangay received not only quality and free medicines but, more importantly, professional advice and services from highly qualified volunteer dentists and medical doctors. The beneficiaries were mostly indigenous peoples like the Higaonon, a community of 13 tribes in 13 barangays in Cagayan de Oro.

The Jose Marie Q. Almirante Medical Scholarship Foundation is funded by Odyssey Driving School. The Foundation aims to help deserving but less fortunate students who desire to become doctors at the Dr. Jose P. Rizal College of Medicine at Xavier University-Ateneo de Cagayan.

Odyssey is in the forefront of every road safety campaign, fulfilling its corporate social responsibility as a true advocate on road safety.

Artecia Habla, a lumad and one of the beneficiaries of the mission, said she and her children who had health problems were checked up by doctors and dentists and received food and medicines. The Habla family was one of the many poorest of the poor in sitio Iba in Dansolihon.

Meanwhile, a member of Cubayan family, also from the poorest of the poor, expressed gratitude for being a beneficiary in sitio Balongkot. Teary-eyed Cubayan -- who was also given snacks, breakfast and lunch meals -- approached and thanked Atty. Almirante and Engr. Besana and Mr. Magsaysay.

Atty. Almirante is the founder of Odyssey Driving School.

“Medical missions like this is a lifetime commitment of the Jose Marie Q. Almirante Medical Scholarship Foundation. As long as we have the resources, we will provide free medicines and consultation to our less fortunate brothers and sisters," said Atty. Almirante.

"Moreover, we would like to mention the special contribution of Odyssey Driving School for making things possible. Odyssey Driving School’s existence is dedicated to fund the foundation of my brother, Jose Marie Q. Almirante, and medical missions like this," he added.

The volunteer doctors who made the mission successful were Dr. Dionne Marie Genise Almero, Dr. Joanna Michele Sabal, Dr. Stephanie Derequito Jarales, Dr. John Paul Oliveros, Dr. Gerry Abadies, Dr. Ricky Echano, Dr. Floyd Marfori, and Dr. Eunice Afdal. WE SALUTE YOU FOR YOUR PURE HEART AND UNSELFISH DEDICATION TO SERVE THE NEEDY!
