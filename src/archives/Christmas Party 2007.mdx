Odyssey Driving School, a strong advocate for road safety, recently organized a Christmas party for the children of Holy Child Orphanage at Lumbia, Cagayan de Oro. The party was facilitated by Jollibee.

The children's party served as Odyssey Driving School's way of paying forward the blessings of the milestone year 2007. With the help of Sister Villegas, the orphans aged 3 to 11 enjoyed the food and the games prepared by Odyssey Driving School and Jollibee. Shown in the photos are the children with their new toys given by employees of Odyssey Driving School.
