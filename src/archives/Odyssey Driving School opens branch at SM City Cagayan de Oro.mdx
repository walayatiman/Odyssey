In line with its corporate mission, which is to promote road safety in major cities in the Philippines, Odyssey Driving School recently opened a branch at the ground floor of the car building of SM City in uptown Cagayan de Oro.

Odyssey Driving School, a strong advocate on road safety and eco-friendly driving, believes that collaborating with a mall like SM is a bold step towards achieving its corporate mission and vision.

Odyssey Driving School is inspired to open a branch in SM because SM is a green environment advocate.
